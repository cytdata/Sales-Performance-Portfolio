# 2020-2023 Sales Performance Analysis & Dashboard
Customer Base Optimization & Growth Strategy

## 1- Project Background

Analyzed data and growth strategies from 2020 to 2023 to identify patterns that enhanced sales performance in 2023. The crucial factors **driving revenue growth were significant lead list expansion** and **strategic improvements** in our sales approach. To ensure data confidentiality, I created a synthetic dataset to represent my personal sales performance.

## 2- Dataset Overview

#### 2-1 Dataset
The 2023 results are based on historical data analysis. The dashboard shows how strategic changes led to performance improvements. It includes key insights into revenue, list quantity, and conversion rates by marketing channel effectiveness and customer demographics. By visualizing this data, the factors identified help improve data analysis and optimize sales strategies to enhance sales performance and optimize sales strategies. Based on the ratio, I created a synthetic dataset to protect sensitive information.

#### 2-3 Key Objectives  
1. Analyze the factors affecting sales performance, focusing on increasing revenue and improving strategies.

4. Develop data-driven recommendations for continued growth and improve internal management effectiveness.
5. By analyzing demographic factors such as age and gender, focus on segmenting customer groups more effectively and implementing precision marketing strategies.


## 3- Executive Summary
During and after the Covid-19 era, sales have continued to decline with significant drops in late 2021. Key performance indicators have all shown year-over-year decreases: revenue by 1.7%, order volume by 10.9%and potential clientele by 24.2%. Although the conversion rate increased, I implemented exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors that could improve sales performance and set the foundation for our 2023 strategic initiatives.

Based on insights from EDA, including optimizing customer service processes, implementing targeted marketing, and managing potential clients on the CRM system, sales have continued to rise with substantial growth. Key performance indicators have all shown year-over-year increases: total sales reached $5.12M (+25.3% YoY), the potential clientele increased by 29.3%, and order quantity sold by 41.9%. 
The strongest marketing drivers were friend referrals, search engine marketing, and walk-in customers, each with over 40% growth in conversion.
