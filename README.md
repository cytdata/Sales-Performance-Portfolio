# 2020-2023 Sales Performance Analysis & Dashboard
Customer Base Optimization & Growth Strategy

## 1- Project Background

Analyzed data and growth strategies from 2020 to 2023 to identify patterns that enhanced sales performance in 2023. The crucial factors **driving revenue growth were significant lead list expansion** and **strategic improvements** in our sales approach. To ensure data confidentiality, I created a synthetic dataset to represent my personal sales performance.

## 2- Dataset Overview

#### 2-1 Dataset
The 2023 results are based on historical data analysis. The dashboard shows how strategic changes led to performance improvements. It includes key insights into revenue, list quantity, and conversion rates by marketing channel effectiveness and customer demographics. By visualizing this data, the factors identified help improve data analysis and optimize sales strategies to enhance sales performance and optimize sales strategies. Based on the ratio, I created a synthetic dataset to protect sensitive information.

#### 2-2 Data Structure

**Data Structure**
![schema](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04926770-32de-4dbc-bc9c-30d205c79f23)

**Key Features**   
`role_status`: Current role of the customer (e.g. student, employed, unemployed).  
`education`: Highest degree earned or current academic standing.  
`purpose`: Reason for initial consultation.  
`by_channel`: Source of customer lead.  
`non_conversion_reason`: Reason for non-conversion.


#### 2-3 Key Objectives  
1. Utilize Excel for data collection and cleaning; use Tableau for data preprocessing and creating interactive dashboards.
2. Analyze sales performance trends from 2020-2023 to identify growth patterns and resolve problems during off-season periods, with focus on demographic influences on purchasing behavior.
3. Compare and analyze different marketing channels to find out the higher conversion rate for enhancing revenue.
4. Identify factors that contributed to the 25.3% revenue increase in 2023 and duplicate the successful strategies for implementation.
5. Develop data-driven recommendations for continued growth and improve internal management effectiveness.

## 3- Executive Summary
Based on the chart, a decline in sales was observed during the first half of 2020. Analysis revealed that the primary reason was the disproportionately high percentage of students in the customer base, which created an imbalance due to seasonal fluctuations. The main solution is to increase the proportion of employed customers as a priority task to balance out seasonal effects. Although 'referral by friends' and 'repeat purchases' show higher conversion rates, both sources have the lowest number of people. The strategy should be modified to build lead lists in the CRM system to increase membership numbers. Additionally, we should monitor membership status and analyze patterns to understand what drives repeat purchases. According to data, 20.5% of non-conversions are due to customers cannot afford the products. To address this, we should provide more payment method options such as Line Pay and JKO Pay, and extend the monthly loan periods to reduce customers' financial pressure. Junior and senior college students show a higher proportion of responses indicating they are 'not ready to face' or have 'no immediate needs'. However, since they will soon face graduate school entrance exams or employment, they actually have higher potential needs. After discussing with supervisors, this situation will be improved.

In 2023, we tracked our progress weekly and discussed with various departments about increasing both customer numbers and sales of different digital products. The results show rapid growth in 'referral by friends' and 'repeat purchases' categories. The overall list increased by 47%, with an impressive conversion rate of 4.4%, achieving a remarkable 66.4% surge in sales revenue, significantly outperforming the previous year.

## 5- Conclusion
Established a CRM system for tracking lead lists and providing customized services, which rapidly increased the total customer base, resulting in 47.1% growth compared to the previous year. Additionally, we offered personalized interactions for each customer, including career development advice and post-class feedback. These improvements enhanced customer willingness to make repeat purchases, resulting in 66.4% sales growth.  

Analysis shows that maintaining a stable conversion rate while increasing the customer base leads to sales performance growth. Moving forward, I will focus on analyzing CRM data to implement effective sales strategies, such as providing customized services and sending regular updates to leads, aiming to further elevate sales performance.
